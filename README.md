### Weather App Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the Weather App on your local machine:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**

2. **Create a New Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir weather-app
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. **Initialize a Node.js Project:**
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```

5. **Create Project Files:**
   ```bash
   touch app.js weatherData.js public/index.html public/css/styles.css views/index.hbs
   ```

6. **Set Up Directory Structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir public views public/css
   ```

7. **Add Project Code:**
   - Copy and paste the code for `app.js`, `weatherData.js`, `index.hbs`, and `styles.css` into their respective files.

8. **Replace API Key (if applicable):**
   - If your project uses APIs that require an API key, replace the placeholder API key in your code with your actual API key.

9. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

10. **Access Your Application:**
    - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or the port specified in your `app.js` file to access your weather application.
