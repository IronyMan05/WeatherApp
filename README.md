# WeatherApp

To install the necessary dependencies and set up your project environment, follow these steps using commands in a terminal or command prompt:

Install Node.js and npm:
If you haven't already installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), you can download and install them from the official Node.js website: Node.js Download
Create a New Project Directory:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
bash
Copy code
mkdir weather-app
cd weather-app
Initialize a Node.js Project:
Use npm to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a package.json file that will store your project's dependencies and settings.
bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Install Express.js, Handlebars, and Request:
Install Express.js, Handlebars (for templating), and Request (for making HTTP requests) using npm.
bash
Copy code
npm install express express-handlebars request
Create Project Files:
Create the necessary files for your project, such as app.js for server-side code, weatherData.js for weather data retrieval logic, and CSS/HTML files for styling and UI.
bash
Copy code
touch app.js weatherData.js public/index.html public/css/styles.css views/index.hbs
Set Up Directory Structure:
Organize your project files into directories. Place HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files in the public directory, and Handlebars templates (index.hbs) in the views directory.
bash
Copy code
mkdir public views public/css
Add Project Code:
Copy and paste the code for app.js, weatherData.js, index.hbs, and styles.css into their respective files.
Replace Placeholder API Key:
If your project uses APIs that require an API key (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), replace the placeholder API key in your code with your actual API key.
Start the Server:
Start your Node.js server to run your application.
bash
Copy code
node app.js
Access Your Application:
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 or the port specified in your app.js file to access your weather application.
These steps will help you set up and run your Node.js weather application locally on your machine. Adjust the commands and file paths as needed based on your project structure and requirements.
